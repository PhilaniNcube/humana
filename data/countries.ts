I also received support to train over 50 young people in the camp, ensuring the benefits of my learning reached others. TVET gave me not just knowledge but the confidence and resources to create meaningful change.',

        story: 'In Kenyaâ€™s Kakuma Refugee Camp, I saw talented women unable to earn a living due to a lack of market access and training. The skills were there, but the tools to turn them into income were not. Through TVET, I gained modern craft techniques and digital marketing skills, which enabled me to launch Craft for Life, an initiative that helps women transform their talents into marketable products now sold internationally.TVET also gave me the ability to teach financial literacy, empowering over 75 women to achieve economic independence.',

        story: 'In Rwanda, I encountered gender stereotypes that made it difficult for women like me to succeed in technology. Many doubted my ability to lead or create innovative solutions, but I was determined to prove them wrong. TVET equipped me with automation and app development skills, enabling me to design Sot, a mobile app that improves public transport by letting commuters book tickets and track buses. My work has made transport more accessible, especially for communities with limited access to resources. More importantly, my success is encouraging other women to consider careers in technology.',
